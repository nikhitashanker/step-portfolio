      <p>I am a rising junior and a CS major in UCLA's School of Engineering. I am from Sunnyvale, CA, and in my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, running, and crafting. Previously, I worked as a Quality Engineering Intern at ServiceNow and have some experience in web development.</p>
      <p>In my freetime, I like to do arts and crafts. Here is my most recent drawing which is a monkey in the rain.</p>
